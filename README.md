  Hello, Guys! My nickname as you can see(in this case why am I writing this in the first place?) is @doffyD. 
For past time I've grown to be increasingly intrested in CS and everything that's related.
  I seem to dwell on the subject seriously this week. Currently I'm making my way through CS50 coz I've heard it's
the best CS course(at least out of free ones) and so far it feels really great. Probably volume of information might 
be a little overwhelming, but on the contrary I don't appoint my goal as understanding every single concept on the spot.
I think it's okay to just move on if you dont understand smth immidiatly. First of all, Im taking this course rather to get 
a grasp, a bird's eyeview of what's going on with all thise techologies and programming. 
  If you'd like to talk(i dunno why u would though)you can contact me via email KKrausCC@gmail.com. 
Best of luck to you all guys! Don't give up even when you're really tired or bored or overwhelmed or anything. :)
